## Module 1: Memory Management

### Overview  
This module implements memory management using *paging and segmentation*. It is designed to efficiently allocate and track memory usage in a structured manner.  

### Features  
- *Paging:* Divides memory into fixed-size blocks to optimize allocation.
- *Segmentation:* Allocates memory based on process requirements.
- *Memory Tracking:* Displays real-time memory usage tables.
- *Memory Deallocation:* Releases memory when it is no longer needed.  

### How It Works  
1. *Paging:* Splits memory into fixed-size pages and assigns them to available frames.  
2. *Segmentation:* Divides memory into logical sections with specific base addresses and limits.  
3. *Tracking:* Displays memory allocation and deallocation tables in real-time.  

### How to Use  
1. Compile the C++ code using:  
   bash
   g++ module1.cpp -o module1.out
   ./module1.out
     
2. Execute the program to observe memory allocation and tracking.  
3. The program will automatically allocate, display, and then deallocate memory.  

### Example Output  
plaintext
=== Paging Example ===
Pages allocated successfully.
Page Table:
Page Number -> Frame Number
   0 -> 3
   1 -> 5
   2 -> 7
   3 -> 2
Memory freed successfully!

=== Segmentation Example ===
Segments allocated successfully.
Segment Table:
Segment ID -> Base Address -> Limit
   0 -> 1000 -> 100
   1 -> 1100 -> 200
   2 -> 1300 -> 300
Segments freed successfully!
  

This module demonstrates memory allocation and deallocation through paging and segmentation methods.


# Real-Time Memory Allocation Tracker (Module 3)

## Overview

This module manages memory allocation using *Paging* and *Segmentation. It includes a **C++ program* for handling memory and a *Python script* for real-time visualization.

## Features

### Paging

- Allocates and deallocates memory pages.
- Tracks available memory frames.
- Saves memory status to memory_status.txt.

### Segmentation

- Allows up to 5 memory segments.
- Tracks base and limit addresses.

### Real-Time Memory Visualization

- Uses *Matplotlib* in Python to display memory allocation.
- Reads memory_status.txt and updates the visualization live.

## How It Works

1. *Run the C++ Program*

   - Compile and execute memory_tracker.exe.
   - Use the menu to allocate or free memory.

2. *Visualize Memory in Real-Time*

   - Run memory_visualizer.py.
   - The program will update the memory allocation display every second.

## How to Run

### C++ Program

sh
 g++ memory_tracker.cpp -o memory_tracker.exe
 ./memory_tracker.exe


### Python Visualization

sh
python memory_visualizer.py


## Requirements

- *Matplotlib* for the Python script:

sh
pip install matplotlib


## Files


├── memory_tracker.cpp   # C++ Memory Management Program
├── memory_visualizer.py # Python Visualization Script
├── memory_status.txt    # Memory Status File (Generated by C++)


## Notes

- Run the *C++ program first* before starting the Python script.
- The memory status updates every second.
- You can modify TOTAL_FRAMES or PAGE_SIZE in the C++ file to adjust memory settings.

Happy Coding!
